                            I am John Ferlito, the Owner of Mix3 Sound, Inc., where my passion for audio engineering comes to life. With over 20 years of experience
                            in the Audio Industry, I have finely tuned my skills as an Audio Engineer. I take immense pride in providing top-notch audio equipment
                            rentals and am deeply committed to ensuring seamless experiences for touring professionals.
                            Throughout my career, I have also delved into the world of coding. These diverse experiences
                            have empowered me to not only master the technical aspects of audio engineering but also to cultivate my creativity in web development,
                            enabling me to craft my own web projects.
                            When I'm not immersed in the world of equipment rentals, you'll often find me expanding my coding knowledge. I firmly believe that continuous
                            learning is key to personal and professional growth.
                            I am particularly excited about the opportunities presented by edX Boot Camps, as they align perfectly with my enthusiasm for ongoing education
                            and skill enhancement. I eagerly anticipate the learning journey ahead and the new possibilities it will unlock.
